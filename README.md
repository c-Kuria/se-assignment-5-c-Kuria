# SE-Assignment-5
Installation and Navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
 Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of the installation and navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Installation of VS Code:
   - Describe the steps to download and install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11 operating system. Include any prerequisites that might be needed.

      sudo snap install code (linux user)

2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.

      workspace setting e.g path and also extensions

3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.

      1. Activity Bar

      Purpose: Provides quick access to common tasks, such as debugging, running, file navigation, and search.

      2. Side Bar

      Purpose: Provides context-specific information and options related to the currently open files or active tab.

      4. Status Bar

      Purpose: Provides context-aware information and options.

4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.

      The Command Palette is a powerful tool in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) that allows you to quickly access commands, actions, and settings

      Common Tasks Using the Command Palette:
         Open Files/Folders: Type the name of the file or folder you want to open.
         Find/Replace Text: Type "Find" or "Replace" to open the respective find/replace dialog.
         Preview Files: Type "Preview" to preview a selected file or open it in a new preview tab.
         Run Tasks: Type "Tasks" to see a list of available tasks and run them.

5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.

      Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions are software modules that enhance the functionality of the code editor. They provide additional features, improve workflow efficiency, and tailor VS Code to specific development environments.

      Examples:
         code runner
         live server


6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?

      press ctrl + shift + ` 

      Advantages:
         Improved Debugging: Provides debugging functionality directly within the IDE, simplifying the debugging process.
         Enhanced Productivity: Allows for quick and easy execution of commands and navigation through the file system.

7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
      
      Users can create a new file by clicking the new file tab with a plus(+) sign and name the file.
      Users can navigate betwwen different files and directories effeciently by pressing ctrl + E or switching at the files/tabs manually by clicking.


8. Settings and Preferences:
   - Where can users find and customize settings in VS Code? Provide examples of how to change the theme, font size, and keybindings.

      Users can use the Command Palette to search and customize settings

      Example:
         Press ctrl + shift + p to open the command palette and search for theme. Right click to select your preferred theme.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?


      Steps to Set Up and Start Debugging a Simple Program in VS Code:

         Create a project: Create a new project or open an existing one in VS Code.
         Install the debugger extension: Install the 'Debugger for [language]' extension for your programming language (e.g.,
         Debugger for Python
         for Python).
         Add breakpoints: Set breakpoints to the lines of code you want to pause execution at.
         Start debugging: Use the "Run and Debug" button in the VS Code toolbar or press F5 (for Windows) or Fn+F5 (for Mac).
         Step through code: Use the debug toolbar to step through the code line by line (e.g., F10 for "Step Over", F11 for "Step Into", F5 for "Continue").
         Inspect variables: Hover over variables to view their values or use the "Variables" tab in the debugger sidebar.

      Key Debugging Features in VS Code:

         Breakpoints: Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines of code.
         Call Stack: View the stack frames to trace the execution path of the program.
         Variable Inspection: Inspect the values of variables at specific breakpoints or during execution.
         Step Control: Step through the code line by line to control the execution flow.
         Watch Expressions: Add expressions to watch and track their values dynamically.
         Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger under specific conditions.
         Logging: Add logging statements to track the program's execution flow and identify potential issues.
         Remote Debugging: Debug programs running on remote machines or containers.
         Source Map Integration: Debug transpiled or minified code by mapping it to the original source code.
         CodeLens Debugging: View debugging information (e.g., breakpoints, variable values) directly in the code editor.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

      Integrating Git with VS Code

         1. Install Git:

         Download and install Git: https://git-scm.com/download

         Open VS Code and install the "Git" extension:
         Go to the Extensions tab (View > Extensions)
         Search for "Git" and click Install

      Initializing a Repository

         Open the project folder in VS Code.
         Open the Source Control tab (View > Source Control)
         Click on the "Initialize Repository" button.
         A new
         .git
         folder will be created in the project folder.

       Making Commits

         Stage the changes you want to commit:
         Select the files or changes you want to commit.
         Right-click and select "Stage Changes"
         Create a commit message:
         In the Source Control tab, click on "Create Commit"
         Type your commit message in the text box.
         Commit the changes:
         Click on "Commit"

      Pushing Changes to GitHub

         Create a GitHub repository:
         Go to https://github.com
         Click on "New" and create a repository.
         Push your local changes to GitHub:
         In VS Code's Source Control tab, click on "Publish to GitHub"
         Enter your GitHub username and password.
         Select the remote repository you want to push to.
